complex structure originates poor execution time.
security of the data directly depends on the key length,higher key length wil provide 
higher secucity but it can increase the executioni time.

According to a research paper published by H. Alanazi et al 
[3] it is shown that AES is better and securer than DES and 
DES III is in nine factors. The first factor is the differences 
in the key length for each one of them, for example the key 
length of DES is 56bits, for DES III is ((for k1, k2 and k3) 
168 bits, (k1 and k2 is same) 112 bits), and for AES it is 
(128,192 and 256 bits). The second factor is the 
cryptographic type; all of them have the same cipher type 
which is (symmetric block cipher). The third factor is the 
block size, the DES block size is 64 bits long and for AES 
128 bits, 192 bits and 256 bits). The forth factor shows the 
Cryptanalysis resistance for example, DES is vulnerable to 
linear and differential to cryptanalysis. It also has weak 
substitution tables; DES III is also vulnerable to differential 
and brute force attacks by analyzıng plaintext using 
differential cryptanalysis, but AES is a strong truncated 
differential, against differential, interpolation, linear, and 
square attacks. The fifth factor concerns the security; the 
DES security is proven inadequate, the DES III is also 
proven inadequate. Like DES while the AES is considered 
secure. The sixth factor is possible keys, the possible keys 
for DES is 256, for DES III are 2112 and 2 168, and for AES are 
2128, 2192 and 2256. The seventh factor is the possibility of 
ASCII printable character keys for DES is 957
, for DES III 
is 9514 and 9521 for AES is 9516,9524 and 9532.the eighth 
factor is time check all possible keys required at 50 billion 
keys per second for a 56 bit key of DES it requires 400 
days , for a 112- bit key of DES III it requires 800, and for a 
128 bit key of AES :5X1021 years. The ninth factor is the 
developed year of each one of them; DES was developed in 
1977, DES III was developed in 1978, AES was developed 
in 2000 [3]

AES algorithm has some 
vulnerability that leads to different attacks on its algorithm 
for instance: Cache-timing attacks, power analysis of key 
scheduling of AES etc. 

On the other hand AES is not 
totally resistant against different types of Side Channel 
Attacks including timing attack, cache collision timing 
attacks, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption 
attack. The timing attack is an application level attack that 
attacks cipher text only and could happen to any application 
that doesn’t work in a steady time, rather than to rely on the 
input so the high speed AES software application is in 
danger against this kind of attack because it executes a 
series of S-box lookups relying on variable time among 
rounds, as the last round in AES encryption does not include 
the Mix Column stage
#############################

We have seen that the greatest risk attacks to AES algorithm 
is the side channel attacks because they have the ability to 
take back the secret key of AES encryption being executed 
on small devices like smart cards easily. Other names for 
side channel attacks are differential attacks covering power 
analysis attacks, timing attacks and so on. Side channel 
attack can be countered by applying security software 
applications or hardware protection algorithms. The other 
weak point of the AES algorithm is the cache memory 
processer leakage which causes the differential timing for 
memory access that attackers take advantage of and uses it 
to obtain information concerning the secret key.

[5] Countering AES Static S-Box Attack
  (Read again)

In this paper we firstly covered a concise study on various 
AES attacks. In addition we provided a simple 
implementation of our novel approach to update the s-box 
table per each round based on a mirrored position sub-key to 
protect AES from s-box analysis and similar side channel 
attacks. The implementation is provided in C language in 
detail suitable for both computers and embedded targets.

#########################################
 The substitution box (S-Box) is among the most sensitive parameters of this standard, which plays a crucial role in the protection against these attacks.A good S-Box is the one that achieves a high quality for most of its
cryptographic properties. However, it is difficult to find an S-Box
that fulfils all the cryptographic criteria at the same time. This is
due to the fact that some of these properties are contradictory to
each other's. This is reflected in the weakening of some criteria in
trying to improve others.



[6]  Advanced encryption standard based on key dependent S-Box cube 
	(wriiter : Athmane Seghier1 )

use round key for random rotaion on static s-box like s-box.n this study, a new AES version is proposed, based on keydependent S-Box cube, in which six S-Boxes are constructed with
distinct irreducible polynomials key dependently selected. These SBoxes are used to select for each round, through the movement of
the Cube guided by a fragment from the round key, an initial S-Box
processed by a round constant to obtain an active round S-Box.

[7] Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Security  Enhancement using Hybrid Approach
               writer (Flevina Jonese D’souza)\

OutComes:  The system will use 128 bits data and 128 bits key length. 
The sender will start the process by message transmission. The 
key will be dynamically generated based on function of time 
when sender logs in to system. In next step the S-box will be 
made dynamic by performing circular shift of it by value 
obtained after XOR on all bytes of round key. There will be 
added phase of creating S-box dynamic. Before substitute byte 
transformation stage, the static s-box will be transformed into
dynamic using cipher key. For the decryption process, inverse 
S-box will also be changed from static to dynamic in similar 
way to dynamic S-box.

To calculate the performance of the suggested algorithm, the two parameters were used; these parameters are 
avalanche effect and execution time. The results achieved by applying the proposed technique show better
performance of the algorithm as compared existing algorithm.

###########################################################
 under the same key length and 
for the same size of the processed data, RSA is about several hundred times slower than AES, triple-DES is 
about three times slower than AES, and there are other runtime characteristics which further highlights the 
difference between these three cryptographic algorithms and provides a reference value for people’s rational 
using
#############################################################

Execution time of algorithm directly depends on the functionality of the algorithm and it’s clearly 
defines that more complex structure originates poor execution time. Security of the data directly depends on the 
key length, higher key length will provide higher security but it can increase the execution time of the algorithm 
so it is very important that what should be the key length and how execution time got controlled, if selected key 
length is higher. Avalanche effect is a desirable property of any encryption algorithm, in this a small change in 
either the plaintext or the key, produces a significant change in the cipher text. So it can play an important role 
in security issue. Another issue is the memory utilization because different encryption algorithms require 
different memory size for implementation. This memory requirement depends on the number of operations to be 
done by the algorithm. It is desirable that the memory required should be as small as possible. Selection of 
operation is also responsible to increase or decrease the overall performance of the proposed algorithm.

3. Advantage of Proposed Model:-
 Efficient
 Robustness
 Secured
 Simple

###########################################################
Here two different parameters are used to evaluate performance of the proposed system. First is 
avalanche effect and second is encryption and decryption time
###########################################################
There are many algorithms available for the encryption and decryption 
but the most efficient technique is RSA and AES by the performance and response time. 
##########################################################
It is widely
believed that any cryptosystem having good dynamic and randomness properties can easily
resist these kind of modern attacks
######################################################
The use of
any known S-box transformation or any additive constant is not good way to create dynamic
substitution, because, the known parameters always help the cracker in cryptanalysis. Thus,
the predefined substitution with publically know S-Box is a noteworthy challenge with
current symmetric cryptosystems
